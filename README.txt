to gain access to a barracks and vehicle depot. Send harvesters to collect the resource that
is spawned on the map to purchase the barracks and vehicle depot. purchase marine units from
the barracks and vehicles from the depot with resources.

Control your units around the map and lead them to the enemy to destroy them.
If you die you lose.

Beginning in RTS-MOD
*************************************************
You will spawn at the beginning of the Aquaducts(convoy2) map as in the story. You will be 
greeted by Tech Holtz who will give you the nailgun mod(this is irrelevent no nailgun mod is given).
You start off with 500 resources enough to buy the command center and a miner. The miner will 
collect your resource on the map when you command it to. Collect enough resource to buy the 
barracks and place it onto the map to build soldiers. Continue collecting resources to build a
vehicle depot and build an army. Take your army to seek and destroy the AI team.
